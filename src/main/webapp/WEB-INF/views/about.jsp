            <strong>Bajoneando meaning</strong>
            <p>
                Bajonear is a salvadorean-spanish verb that you use to refer
                to the action of eating after hours, probably after a party or 
                a long day at work. 
                You can use it when you are famished and heading towards to
                grab a bite, something like <em>I am going to bajonear</em></p>
            <p>
                I am Bajoneando as you can see in the footer because I usually 
                program at work only but nowadays I have been feeling like 
                programming after hours with a cup of joe, nuts, dried fruit 
                or any paleo snack that I can eat
